# Cisco-EEM-PortTracker
This Cisco Embedded Event Manager (EMM) applet will trigger from a syslog msg and gather the needed information on the port in question and perform several actions.

This is used in conjunction with my "TheMadScripter" videos that are released. These are the configuration files for those examples. Enjoy!
